Yet Another GPS Tracker? - yes, but:

- this is a nice one - thanks to excellent design by expo7! And you can set your custom background and button images;

- can select GPS run interval: from "always on" to "run every 10 min" - this is useful if you want to reduce battery power usage;

- has usual cycle computer display: time, distance, speed (current, average, max) plus a graph of your track.

The tool logs GPS data into a binary file (so a lot of data can be stored in a compact form), which can be loaded back for viewing, or saved into .kml / .gpx file to view in e.g. GoogleEarth.
